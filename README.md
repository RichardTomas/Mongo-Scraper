# Mongo-Scraper

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## Dependencies

- express
- express-handlebars
- mongoose
- body-parser
- cheerio
- request
